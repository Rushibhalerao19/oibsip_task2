                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Subhash Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist leader and one of the key figures in India's struggle for independence against British rule during the early to mid-20th century. He was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, India, and died on August 18, 1945.</p>   
                <p>Bose was deeply influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi. However, he developed a difference of opinion with Gandhi's approach of nonviolent resistance and sought more radical means to free India from colonial rule. He believed in taking direct action and formed the Forward Bloc in 1939, advocating for complete independence from British rule.</p> </article>
